## 🧩 Architecture Highlights

### **State Management (NgRx)**
The application uses a centralized store to manage data consistency across components.
*   **Products:** Fetched once and cached, with stock updates reflected instantly.
*   **Cart:** Persisted to `localStorage` so users don't lose items on refresh.
*   **Auth:** Token-based session management with auto-login capabilities.

### **Mock Backend**
To ensure a realistic experience without a running server, `ShopApiService` intercepts HTTP calls and mimics a database using browser storage. This allows for:
*   Persistent User Sessions
*   Persistent Order History
*   Real-time Stock Decrementing
